<h1>Processing Data of Mass Spectrometry</h1>

<h3>Signal Resampling </h3>
<p>Resampling is a process in which a new signal is obtained
with controlled m / z values, this new signal should be as far as possible
similar to the original. Controlled values means that the number of points may be higher, 
at or below the original signal. When the signal is resampled higher resolution down sampling is 
performed when the signal is of lower resolution sampling is above and to obtain the same 
resolution only syncs. The EM data are high resolution so it is difficult to work with 
computational intensive algorithms that can reach the limit of your computer. An acceptable 
measure to obtain a decision manageable data by eliminating redundant data signals thus obtaining uniform length.

To reduce or increase the resolution of the spectra using a sampling frequency converter 
with the factor I / D. Where, I represents interpolation and D decimation.</p>

<h3>Correcting the Background </h3> 
<p>The data generally show a variable line based on a result of chemical noise or overload matrix ions. It 
arises from the ion detector when saturated. This saturation decreases slowly with time. 
The baseline is a displacement of the ions in the vertical axis raises the values of m / z low while 
high values of m / z not as affected. To correct this problem the baseline is estimated and subtracted 
from the original spectrum that is the lowest point of the spectrum is and drag it to zero on the vertical axis.

Several techniques have been developed that help estimate the baseline as high pass filters implemented with 
fast Fourier transform, wavelet theory and digital filters. The methods mentioned are unusual as these 
introduce artifacts and distort the signal and would need to model a filter for each spectrum. With these 
considerations, the most widely used algorithm for estimating the baseline in MS is based on spline
interpolation or smoothing.</p>

<h3>Aligning Mass/Charge Values </h3> 

<p>The baseline correction is critical before the step of aligning peaks because
there is significant variation between the samples of the intensity and location of the peaks in $m/z$, 
by bad calibration mass spectrometers. The main idea is to replace
the original values of m / z for calibrated or aligned m / z, defining a vector of peaks with maximum 
intensity values, the non-aligned peaks shift to higher intensity peaks, obtaining new vectors of intensity 
values.</p>

<h3>Normalizing Relative Intensity </h3>
<p>Normalization was performed to compare the relative intensities of the different spectra. 
This method is used to identify and eliminate variations samples having randomly and which 
are caused by the limited sensitivity of the receiver and noise.

At this stage it is necessary to change the scale of the maximum intensity in each spectrum and assign a certain 
value and the other values are adjusted in proportion to this value.</p>

<h3>Smoothing Noise </h3>  
<p>In this stage it is to reduce electrical noise caused by instrumentation type. For this smoothing techniques 
applied through the digital or smoothing filters. Digital filters that can be applied are the type Infinite 
Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR), which must be designed according to their frequency 
characteristics therefore not recommended.

Filtering or smoothing polynomial smoothing is shown signal sample polynomial based on a regional setting. This 
type of filter is adapted to the sampling rate variation and maintains the sharpness of the peaks. Polynomial 
smoothing method is the most widely accepted Savitzky-Golay and Kaiser digital filter employing a least squares 
polynomial which retains most of the characteristics of the signal and the resolution between peaks height ions 
and peaks.

But such algorithms requires a more comprehensive analysis software.</p>
