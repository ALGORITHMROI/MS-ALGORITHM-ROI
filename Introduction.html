<p>Mass spectrometry (MS) produces data represented in vectors and matrices enormous. The measurements are represented by real numbers.</p>

<p>Detecting compound it may be performed with a very small sample of saliva, urine or blood and thus obtain the required information.</p>

<p>This technique represents your measurements as discrete signals having a major limitation when processing a large volume of data using computer software and statistical analysis, why apply algorithms to eliminate redundant data, lack of relevant data and information reduce noise instrumentation.</p>

<p>Â The information obtained is stored in digital files ready to be processed computationally, this processing is presented as a set of steps that seeks to eliminate the errors of calibration and measurement errors. At the end of this process a set of smaller size data is obtained and completely homogenous.</p>

<p>Mass spectrometry measurements produced containing many peaks that are useful for identifying compounds and detecting the different anomalies or asymptomatic diseases such as cancer in humans using spectra.  </p>
