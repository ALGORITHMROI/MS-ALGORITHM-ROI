<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Mass spectrometry (MS) produces data represented
vectors and matrices enormous. These measurements whose values are represented in numbers
real. Detecting compound may be carried
out with a very small sample of saliva, urine, or
blood and thus obtain the required information.</p>

<p>This technique is its measurements represented as discrete signals this represents a limitation upon
to process a large volume data
computational and statistical analysis software, why
which apply algorithms to eliminate redundant data,
Data lacking relevant information and decrease
instrumentation noise.</p>

<p>The information obtained is stored in files
digital format ready to be processed computationally,
This processing is presented as a set
stages that seeks to eliminate calibration errors and
measurement errors. At the end of this process you will be obtained
a dataset of smaller dimensions and completely
homogeneous.</p>

<p>Mass spectrometry measurements produce
produce a lot of peaks to identify compounds,
various anomalies or asymptomatic diseases
such as cancer in humans by
Using spectra.</p>
