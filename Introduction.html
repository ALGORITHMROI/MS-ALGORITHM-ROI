<p>Mass spectrometry (MS) produces data represented in vectors and matrices enormous. The measurements are represented by real numbers.</p>

<center>
<p>Detecting compound it may be performed with a very small sample of saliva, urine or blood and thus obtain the required information.</p>
</center>
<center>
<p>This technique represents your measurements as discrete signals having a major limitation when processing a large volume of data using computer software and statistical analysis, why apply algorithms to eliminate redundant data, lack of relevant data and information reduce noise instrumentation.</p>
</center>
<center>
<p> The information obtained is stored in digital files ready to be processed computationally, this processing is presented as a set of steps that seeks to eliminate the errors of calibration and measurement errors. At the end of this process a set of smaller size data is obtained and completely homogenous.</p>

<center> Mass spectrometry (MS) is a very popular technique data
acquisition in research on chronic diseases such as cancer,
adrenal diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis,
and Alzheimer’s. Its popularity is based on the high capacity
that has this technique to extract information, and the easiness
to be integrated into computational methodologies for analysis
of massive data sets. Computational methodologies
used in these medical applications have received tremendous
interest from researchers because through them you can make
analysis and experimentation in a much more comprehensive
than traditional methods. The combination of statistics, probability
and computational simulation can address a number of

cases much more varied than traditional analysis laboratory
experimentation. This technique called mass spectra measurements,
these spectra, for applications analyzed in this paper
come from the analysis of samples of biological fluid (FB) as
saliva or blood serum are performed. These FB have a huge
amount of information on the presence of pathologies in the
human body. This information is represented by biomarkers
(BM), which are substances used in the analysis and diagnosis
of medical conditions. These substances have the ability to
indicate the presence of a disease state, as well as the response
to chemical treatments. The acquired mass spectra consist
of a vector of intensity values, where the abundance of ions
in the gas phase of the sample analyzed and a vector of mass
relationships expressed radius m/z expressed in thomsons
[Th]. Figure 1 shows various measurements of a data set
OvarianCDP ostQAQC.zip, available from the National
Cancer Institute of the United States shown. The process of
analysis of EM measurement data for identification of BM
consists basically of data processing, selection and validation
of patterns with a high degree of intergroup discrimination.
Once validated these patterns, the next step is to translate
them into chemical expressions that can be used as diagnostic
tools and tuning peptides and antigens for the treatment of
the diseases mentioned above. This paper presents a
new method for the identification of patterns of BM through
the combination of three statistical tests t-test, Mann-Whitney
U test and Chi2 in a filter statistical and iterative removal
characteristics of the areas of interest is presented using for
grouping the middle of each zone reducing redundant information.
These results are validated using classification AdaBoost.
This classifiers are especially robust against the effects
of overtraining infraentrenamiento and, besides being easily
adaptable to such applications. With these characteristics it
avoids falling into the misinterpretation of false results and
false positives or negatives. Performance measurement is done
through cross-validation and external tests using independent
samples that have not previously participated in the modeling
of the classifiers. This methodology shows promising results
with an efficiency greater than 95% correct in the tests carried
out. This work is limited to the identification of 2
patterns of biomarkers, leaving for later developments and
their translation into protein chemical compounds. In the
following sections algorithmically the proposed methodology
described in this paper, the tests using three data sets, the first
and the second OvarianCD PostQAQC.zip and Datawcx2 get
of Clinical Proteomics Program of the Center for Research on
Cancer belonging to the National Cancer Institute the United
States and the third Arcene UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Analyzes and compares the results with previous work. In the
last section raises possible extensions to the research presented
and the final part of the section is attached conclusions.
