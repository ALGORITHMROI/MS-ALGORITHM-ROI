<h1>Feature Selection</h1> 
</center>

<p>This section describes the methods used to reduce data dimencionalidad explained. 
This process is to select the percentage of samples that will be discarded based on the results 
of statistical tests performed. The dimensionality reduction is essential in terms of computational 
time optimization and reduction processing the effects of over-training and under-training at the 
stage of pattern classification.</p>
<h3>T-test </h3>

<p>Test T-test is a parametric test that helps in checking a property assuming some hypotheses on data. This test
using the Student t-distribution, this dristibución is a family of curves that varies depending on the degrees of freedom.

To apply the t-test is assumed that:
<br> 
1.The distribution of data should follow a Gaussian or normal curve. 
<br> 
2. The standar deviation of the data are unknown but are assumed to be equal.  
<br> 
Hypotheses to test: Verify that the means of two groups of samples are equal. Where the data 
of each sample can be vectors or matrices. To apply the test is necesary define the statistical "t", 
that helps to accept or reject the hypothesis by comparing the "t" calculated with "t" defined 
Statistical tables available. 

Calculating the statistic is computed as follows:

<p>Where, uA and uB are the mean of each group, s standar deviation,
sA y sB estimating the standard deviation of the samples obtained
available test and MA, MB are numbers of examples in each distribution.</p>
<br>
<p>According to probability and the confidence interval the hypothesis
is accepted or rejected. Test data processing mass spectrometry confidence 
level of 95% and 5% error is stable.</p>

In the image to be observed that a small number of samples differ from others, so that their means are not equal.
These few examples give us information of highly discriminating data.

<h3>U de Mann-Whitney</h3> 
<p>It is a non parametric test that helps determine whether two samples have equal data medium. 
The samples studied do not follow a normal distribution. Statistical U is the minimum value between U1 
and U2 which is defined by the following formula:</p>

<br>
where,
<p>n1 and n2 are the sample sizes</p>
<p>R1 and R2 are the sum of the rank order of the first and second 
samples respectively. It then calculates "z" defined as a contrast statistic to compare 
with a critical "z" and accept or reject the hypothesis.</p>

finally accept or reject the hypothesis.</p>

<h3>Chi-Cuadrado</h3>

<p> Chi-square test (χ²) is a nonparametric test that measures the discrepancy between observed frequencies 
distribution and other theoretical or expected frequencies, indicating to what extent the differences between the
two, and also can test the independence between the two variables.</p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>Oi = Observed absolute frequency</p>

<p>Ei = Expected frequency Ei=n*pi where n is the sample size and pi the probability of the null hypothesis. </ p>

<p> K-1 is the degrees of freedom for a larger n.</p>
